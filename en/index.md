Domaine de l'Amiral, with an area of 1750m2, including 675m2 of living space, is a large and imposing estate. Sometime in the 19th century, it was used as a silkworm farm. This function determined the building's unique and impressive architecture. The logbook from the 1837 attests to the various activities that have taken place in this house over the centuries.

Around 1900, the 4600 m2 park was laid out with 25 cedars. Today, these centenarian cedars are up to 40 metres tall. Besides these beautiful old trees, the park has a large bamboo forest of some 200 m2, a large vegetable garden, a fountain and a spacious terrace.

Around the same time as the park, the house was renovated into a stately manor. Upon entering, an imposing orangery awaits you with a 10-metre high ceiling and stone pillars on which large cross vaults rest. In this room, your eye is immediately drawn to the cabinet of curiosities that continues to amaze. The orangery is partly built into the rock so that it stays nice and cool even in summer. The house with its characteristic elements and charming interior continues to surprise.   
A lazy stone staircase, seven fireplaces, three spacious bathrooms with walk-in showers, cast-iron bathtubs and marble washbasins. At the heart of the house is the Grand Salon, a homely and charming space for festive dinners with ornate ornaments, wooden panelling and a classic wooden parquet floor.

The house is equipped with contemporary elements such as a home cinema and a sheltered south-facing roof terrace. Through the high steel windows of the roof terrace you enter a modern private appartment. Furthermore, the house is equipped with a semi-professional kitchen, four large vaulted cellars, a well and a wine press.   
  
In and around the house there is good mobile coverage.s The house also has a modern fiber connection and therefore has a fast and stable wifi network.
